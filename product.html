There could be a lot of reasons why we reject this fact. Since time past, man has always sought for the secret to longevity. A lot has been said and done about how we can live a longer life. But the hard truth is life is about action. It’s about being on the move. And the only secret you need to know about how to live longer and healthier is to stay active. Well, that’s easier said and done when you are still young and strong. How about when you get a bit older and all fragile? Could being active still count as a viable way to stay younger, or at least feeling like it?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>There you go… being or staying young isn’t about looks or physical features. Although your physical rigors certainty plays an important part about how you feel and your outlook. One of the more effective ways to keep feeling young is through regular physical activities and physical fitness. In other words, living an active lifestyle. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Most people upon reaching senior age would seem resigned to the idea to finally have time to relax -- in a sedentary way. If you are one of these people then good luck on staying independent and enjoying life. The very essence of staying young is to be able to act or move independently the longest time possible. 
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Some older adults may be adamant about the idea of starting to get fit late in life. No matter your age, it’s never too late to get fit. These easy tips will help you get started safely and make it fun.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What are the benefits of exercise for older adults?
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>There are many reasons why we tend to slow down and become more sedentary with age. It may be due to health problems, weight or pain issues, or worries about falling. Or perhaps you think that exercising simply isn’t for you. But as you grow older, an active lifestyle becomes more important than ever to your health.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>A recent Swedish study found that physical activity was the number one contributor to longevity, adding extra years to your life—even if you don’t start exercising until your senior years. But getting active is not just about adding years to your life, it’s about adding life to your years.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Getting moving can help boost your energy, maintain your independence, protect your heart, and manage symptoms of illness or pain as well as your weight. Regular exercise is also good for your mind, mood, and memory.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Physical health benefits
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Helps you maintain or lose weight. As metabolism naturally slows with age, maintaining a healthy weight is a challenge. Exercise helps increase metabolism and builds muscle mass, helping to burn more calories.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Reduces the impact of illness and chronic disease. People who exercise tend to have improved immune and digestive functioning, better blood pressure and bone density, and a lower risk of Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes, obesity, heart disease, osteoporosis, and certain cancers.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Enhances mobility, flexibility, and balance. Exercise improves your strength, flexibility and posture, which in turn will help with balance, coordination, and reducing the risk of falls. Strength training also helps alleviate the symptoms of chronic conditions such as arthritis.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Mental health benefits
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Improves sleep. Quality sleep is vital for your overall health. Regular activity can help you fall asleep more quickly, sleep more deeply, and wake feeling more energetic and refreshed.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Boosts mood and self-confidence. Exercise is a huge stress reliever and the endorphins produced can actually help reduce feelings of sadness, depression, or anxiety. Being active and feeling strong naturally helps you feel more self-confident.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Does amazing things for the brain. Activities like Sudoku or crossword puzzles can help keep your brain active, but little comes close to the beneficial effects of exercise on the brain. It can help brain functions as diverse as multitasking and creativity and can help prevent memory loss, cognitive decline, and dementia. Getting active may even help slow the progression of brain disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Overcoming obstacles to getting active as you age
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Starting or maintaining a regular exercise routine can be a challenge at any age—and it doesn’t get any easier as you get older. You may feel discouraged by health problems, aches and pains, or concerns about injuries or falls. If you’ve never exercised before, you may not know where to begin, or perhaps you think you’re too old or frail, and can never live up to the standards you set when you were younger. Or maybe you just think that exercise is boring.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>While these may seem like good reasons to slow down and take it easy as you age, they’re even better reasons to get moving. Becoming more active can energize your mood, relieve stress, help you manage symptoms of illness and pain, and improve your overall sense of well-being. And reaping the rewards of exercise doesn’t have to involve strenuous workouts or trips to the gym. You can gain the benefits from adding more movement and activity to your life, even in small ways. No matter your age or physical condition, it’s never too late to get your body moving, boost your health and outlook, and improve how you age.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Some myths about activity and aging
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Myth 1: There’s no point to exercising. I’m going to get old anyway.
</strong></p><p><strong>Fact: Regular physical activity helps you look and feel younger and stay independent longer. It also lowers your risk for a variety of conditions, including Alzheimer’s and dementia, heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, high blood pressure, and obesity. And the mood benefits of exercise can be just as great at 70 or 80 as they were at 20 or 30.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Myth 2: Exercise puts me at risk of falling down.
</strong></p><p><strong>Fact: Regular exercise, by building strength and stamina, prevents loss of bone mass and improves balance, actually reducing your risk of falling.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Myth 3: It’s too frustrating: I’ll never be the athlete I once was.
</strong></p><p><strong>Fact: Changes in hormones, metabolism, bone density, and muscle mass mean that strength and performance levels inevitably decline with age, but that doesn’t mean you can no longer derive a sense of achievement from physical activity or improve your health. The key is to set lifestyle goals that are appropriate for your age. And remember: a sedentary lifestyle takes a much greater toll on athletic ability than biological aging.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Myth 4: I’m too old to start exercising.
</strong></p><p><strong>Fact: You’re never too old to get moving and improve your health! In fact, adults who become active later in life often show greater physical and mental improvements than their younger counterparts. If you’ve never exercised before, or it’s been a while, you won’t be encumbered by the same sports injuries that many regular exercisers experience in later life. In other words, there aren’t as many miles on your clock so you’ll quickly start reaping the rewards. Just begin with gentle activities and build up from there.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Myth 5: I can’t exercise because I’m disabled.
</strong></p><p><strong>Fact: Chair-bound people face special challenges but can lift light weights, stretch, and do chair aerobics, chair yoga, and chair Tai Chi to increase their range of motion, improve muscle tone and flexibility, and promote cardiovascular health. Many swimming pools offer access to wheelchair users and there are adaptive exercise programs for wheelchair sports such as basketball.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>Myth 6: I’m too weak or have too many aches and pains.
</strong></p><p><strong>Fact: Getting moving can help you manage pain and improve your strength and self-confidence. Many older people find that regular activity not only helps stem the decline in strength and vitality that comes with age, but actually improves it. The key is to start off gently.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>What if you hate to exercise?
</strong></p><p><strong>If you dread working out, you’re not alone. But you don’t have to exercise until you’re soaked in sweat or every muscle aches to make a big difference to your health. Think about activities that you enjoy and how you can incorporate them into an exercise routine:
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Listen to music or an audiobook while lifting weights.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Window shopping while walking laps at the mall.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Get competitive while playing tennis.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Take photographs on a nature hike.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Meet new people at a yoga class or fitness center.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Watch a favorite movie or TV show while on the treadmill.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Instead of chatting with a friend over coffee, chat while walking, stretching, or strength training.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Walk the golf course instead of using a cart.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Walk or play fetch with a dog. If you don’t own a dog, offer to take a neighbor’s dog for a walk or volunteer at a pet shelter or rescue group.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Go for a run, walk, or cycle when you’re feeling stressed—see how much better you feel afterwards.
</strong></p><p><strong>-- Find an exercise buddy, someone whose company you really enjoy, and try activities you’ve never tried before—you may find something you love. At worst, you’ve spent time with a good friend.
</strong></p><p><strong>
</strong></p><p><strong>All these being said, before embarking into your new or renewed fitness adventure, make sure to consult your doctor first to find out what type of exercises are safe and appropriate for you.
